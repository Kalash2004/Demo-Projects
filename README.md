# AI ChatBot

This is a conversational AI chatbot built using Python and various libraries, designed to interact with users, understand their queries, and provide appropriate responses. The chatbot uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for language understanding and is capable of handling a wide range of user inputs.


## Features

Natural Language Understanding (NLU): The chatbot understands and processes user input using NLP techniques, such as tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition (NER).

Intent Recognition: The chatbot identifies the user's intent based on the input and provides responses accordingly.

Pre-trained Models: The chatbot leverages pre-trained models from libraries like NLTK, TensorFlow, or Scikit-learn for machine learning-based responses.

Customizable: Users can train the chatbot with their own intents and responses to make it more personalized.

Multi-intent Support: The chatbot can handle multiple intents and can respond to different types of questions, from casual greetings to more complex queries.

Integration: The chatbot can be integrated with web applications, mobile apps, or desktop programs.


## Technologies Used

Python

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

Scikit-learn

TensorFlow (optional, for advanced training)

JSON (for storing intents and responses)



## Setup Instructions

1) Clone this repository

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chatbot-project.git

```
2) Navigate into the project folder:

```bash
  cd chatbot-project

```
3) Install the necessary dependencies:


```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt

```
4) Run the chatbot:
```bash
  python chatbot.py

```








## How it Works

he chatbot uses a training dataset (intents.json) to understand various intents and associated responses.

It processes user input using NLP techniques to match the input with predefined intents and generate a response.

The chatbot can be trained with new data to enhance its capabilities.
